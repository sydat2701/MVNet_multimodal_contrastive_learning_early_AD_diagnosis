This project is used for early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis (classification task between cognitive normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). It was designed for experiments on ADNI dataset. First, each individual extractor is pretrained on CN, MCI, and AD (Alzheimer class) data using contrastive learning (MVNet_pretrain_extractors folder). Then those learned weights are frozen when combining them in a homogeneous multimodal network (MVNet_multimodal folder).
